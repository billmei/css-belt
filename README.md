# css-belt
A toolbelt with useful CSS utility functions

Uses most of the utility classes from Bootstrap 4 plus some additional ones you might find useful.

Unlike Bootstrap this *doesn't* use `!important` unless absolutely necessary for classes such as `.clearfix`.

To change this behavior you can toggle the `$use-important` variable in `_variables.scss` and recompile.

The others are documented on this page:


If you like Bootstrap 4 and want to start using its utility functions in production code without having to fully upgrade from Bootstrap 3 this library serves as a good stop-gap.
